# SFMLGameEngine

A modular and lightweight 2D game engine built using C++ and SFML.  
This engine provides a solid foundation for developing 2D games, featuring an entity-component system, asset management, animation handling, and basic physics integration.
NOTE : The engine is work in progress - code structure and architecture is bound to evolve over time.
